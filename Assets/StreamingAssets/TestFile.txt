Cymbre
Here's the board, you can see your three instruments at the top, and the three enemies you're up against are down at the bottom. For now we'll just focus on your troops.
Cymbre
As you can see, they're all different both in appearance and stats.
Cymbre
The one with the shield is called "The Guardian" it's great at tanking hits, The Hunter is the one with a bow, and is able to strike from afar, and the last one is The Warrior, he's a glass cannon.
Cymbre
Keep this information in mind moving forward. Speaking of, when you're ready select one of your units to start moving them.
Cymbre
The circle around them that appeared is the distance they're able to travel this turn. Select wherever you want, but it would be wise to start moving them toward the enemy.
Cymbre
Even after you've moved your instrument, you may notice that there's still a circle. This one for their attack range. If an enemy is in that range, select them to have your unit strike it.
Cymbre
Keep in mind what class your Instrument is, your hunter will be able to attack from a distance while the other two will have to get closer.
Cymbre
Now simply repeat the process for the other two.
Cymbre
Now that you've made your moves, the enemy will retaliate.
Cymbre
Great job! You were fantastic.
