CONDUCTOR
Alright. Captain, again.
CAPTAIN
*sigh* You heard the conductor, group five you're up! Get out there and begin when the dolls appear!

Three armed soldiers make their way onto an open field, standing opposed to them is a tent with a faint blue light glowing from its tip nearly a hundred feet away with a figure about to enter it.
CAPTAIN
Are you sure these sparring sessions are necessary Conductor? Your student's dolls collapse before my men can even hit them.
CONDUCTOR
That is what training is for, Captain. The point is to improve. You should know the importance of practice better than anyone else here.
CAPTAIN
I know I know... My concern is that it's hard for your student to improve if they can even begin the training. My men are growing tired, almost seems like a waste.
CONDUCTOR
Conducting is a difficult process, trust me when I say that your men are helping and that progress is being made. Their time is not being wasted.
CAPTAIN
I'm not worried about time, it's the manpower. I've been hearing some reports about a rising conflict around the southeastern border...
CONDUCTOR
Then it only makes it more important that my students are trained and ready to help.
CAPTAIN
Hm, then let's hope they're able to conduct this time. What's taking so long anyway? The dolls are usually out by now.
CONDUCTOR
Cymbre is probably giving them some advice, the dolls will be out and fighting shortly.
CAPTAIN
Do you really think she'll make that happen?
CONDUCTOR
With certainty.
CAPTAIN
Do you even have a way to check on them? Their tent is so far away that you can't even hear a word they're saying.
CONDUCTOR
Conducting requires an intense amount of concentration and focus. The fewer distractions, the better.
CAPTAIN
So you sent another person in there to help? That doesn't make sense.
CONDUCTOR
Trust the process, her help will get the needed results.
CAPTAIN
If you say so...

The entrance of the tent swings open as Cymbre enters. A large flat stone stands in the center with A young student sitting in a chair placed on the far side of it. The student whips their head up with a surprised expression.
STUDENT
Hi-I-uh I-I'm so sorry! I'll get it right this time I promise!
CYMBRE
Calm down, I'm not here to scold you.
STUDENT
W-W-What?
CYMBRE
Quite the opposite actually, I'm here to help.
STUDENT
Wait really?! Oh, thank goodness!
CYMBRE
To start, take a deep breath.
STUDENT
Huh?
CYMBRE
Just take a deep breath. The first step to conducting is to be calm and focused...Which you are not.
STUDENT
O-Oh right! Sorry...I really wanted to get my conducting right. I thought I was really gonna have it this time...But now I'm just a fool and I
CYMBRE
Deep breath, and follow my lead.
STUDENT
Right!

The student takes a deep breath.
CYMBRE
I don't mean to be rude, but that right there's the problem. You're spending so much time worrying about other people and what they're thinking. All you should be worried about is what's in front of you.

She gestures to the table. The student nods in agreement while reaching for an object that resembles a chess piece.
CYMBRE
Starting off correctly is important, it's difficult to conduct a Melody well if not summoned properly. Take that piece and hold it high above your head, and prepare to strike it down onto the board as hard as you can.

The student follows her commands with a confused look on their face
STUDENT
Ok...
CYMBRE
It's a little dramatic, but trust me it'll help. Straining your arm and using that much force is a useful trick that pushes you to give your all when summoning. Once you get more experienced with conducting you won't have to rely on it...
CYMBRE
Hold that pose for a bit, and take some time to clear your thoughts. Focus solely on the task at hand, and when you think you're ready, slam it down.

Silence falls for a few moments.
CYMBRE
Excellent, do it two more times, and then we'll begin.
